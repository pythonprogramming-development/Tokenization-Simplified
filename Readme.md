## Setup

Create and activate a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

```bash
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate virtual environment
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On Unix or MacOS
source venv/bin/activate
```

## Installation

Install required packages and dependencies:

```bash
# Export current dependencies
pip freeze > requirements.txt

# Install specific package
pip install packagename

# Install all requirements
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install spaCy language model
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# Run the scraper
python scraper.py
```

## Tokenization Methods

### 1. Unigram Language Model
- Individual token probability modeling
- Context-independent analysis
- Suitable for basic text processing

### 2. Character Tokenization
- Character-level text segmentation
- Ideal for:
  - Noisy data processing
  - Morphologically rich languages
  - Character-based analysis

### 3. N-gram Tokenization
Sequential token analysis:

#### Types of N-grams
- **Unigram**: Single token units
- **Bigram**: Two consecutive tokens
- **Trigram**: Three consecutive tokens

### 4. Sentence Tokenization
- Text-to-sentence segmentation
- Applications:
  - Sentence-level analysis
  - Document structuring
  - Content summarization

### 5. Word-Level and Subword-Level Hybrid Tokenization
Combined tokenization approach:
- Word-level processing
- Subword segmentation
- Multi-language support

### 6. Morpheme-Based Tokenization
Morphological analysis:
- Root word identification
- Prefix/suffix handling
- Compound word processing

### 7. Specialized Tokenizers

#### Treebank Tokenizer
- Syntax-preserving tokenization
- Parse tree optimization
- Linguistic structure maintenance

#### Tweet Tokenizer
Social media text processing:
- Hashtag handling
- Emoji recognition
- URL processing
- @mention parsing

#### Multi-Word Expression Tokenizer (MWETokenizer)
Phrase-level tokenization:
- Entity recognition
- Idiomatic expression handling
- Compound term processing

## Usage

Example implementation:

```python
# Import required libraries
from your_tokenizer import Tokenizer

# Initialize tokenizer
tokenizer = Tokenizer()

# Process text
text = "Your input text here"
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)
```

**Role of Tokenization in Machine Learning/AI:**
Tokenization is a crucial step in natural language processing (NLP) that involves breaking down text into smaller units, called tokens. These tokens can be words, phrases, or even characters. This process allows machine learning models to understand and manipulate text data more effectively. By converting text into a structured format, tokenization enables models to learn patterns, understand context, and generate coherent responses.

**Roadmap to Proficiency in AI:**
AI -> ML -> NLP -> DL -> GEN AI -> LLM
1. **Fundamentals of Programming:**
   - Learn Python or R for data manipulation and analysis.

2. **Mathematics & Statistics:**
   - Study linear algebra, calculus, probability, and statistics.

3. **Data Handling:**
   - Familiarize yourself with data preprocessing, cleaning, and exploratory data analysis (EDA).

4. **Machine Learning Basics:**
   - Understand supervised and unsupervised learning, model evaluation, and key algorithms (e.g., regression, decision trees).

5. **Deep Learning:**
   - Explore neural networks, particularly for NLP tasks (e.g., recurrent neural networks, transformers).

6. **NLP Techniques:**
   - Study tokenization, embeddings (like Word2Vec or BERT), and advanced NLP models.

7. **Projects & Practical Experience:**
   - Build projects, participate in competitions (like Kaggle), and collaborate on open-source projects.

8. **Stay Updated:**
   - Follow AI research, blogs, and communities to keep abreast of new developments.

By following this roadmap and understanding the role of tokenization, you can build a strong foundation in AI and machine learning!
